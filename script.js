// There will be only two players. One human and one computer (for the Base solution).
// The computer will always be the dealer.
// Each player gets dealt two cards to start.
// If a blackjack is found, a player will instant win.
// The player goes first, and decides if they want to hit (draw a card) or stand (end their turn).
// The dealer has to hit if their hand is below 17.
// Each players' score is the total of their card ranks. Jacks/Queen/Kings are 10. Aces can be 1 or 11.
// The player who is closer to, but not above 21 wins the hand.
